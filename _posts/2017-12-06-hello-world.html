        You don't know me, but you might know my Ed-tech project <a href="http://www.videoorchard.in/">Videoorchard</a></h2>
        <p>At the point of writing this, I've been a software engineer for over 5 years. It sounds crazy saying it out loud. I got my first computer when I was 9. My parents didn't know how to use it, neither did I, but for me it was magical. Power and simplicity, all rolled into one affordable package. As they say, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Anyways, Regardless of how you ended up here, welcome!</p>
        <p>Now I am not a great blogger or writer for that matter, but this is my humble attempt at changing that. Friends and acquaintances have been telling me for the past few years that I should start sharing my thoughts and writing from time to time, so here I am after reading one too many articles about motivation and making things happen.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">I'm in uncharted territory at this point, and I am not sure whether my ideas are correct or even worth sharing, but I am hoping that some of you out there might get some value out of what I end up doing. All of my ventures are hosted on <a href="https://github.com/manishshetty1">Github</a></p>
        <h2 class="mb-5">This site was coded live for your viewing pleasure.</h2>
        <p>Speaking of uncharted territory, I recently started streaming some of my code sessions on Youtube. This website was - mostly - and is build with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and running on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">Besides geeky stuff, I like fresh drip coffee brew, traveling, music and reading (non-fiction) books.</p>
        <h2 class="mb-5">Anyways...</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my website. Keep an eye out for more, and I'll keep myself honest about sharing some thoughts with you all. Until next time!</p>
